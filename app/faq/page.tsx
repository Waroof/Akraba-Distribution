        Please be advised that some of the brands we distribute may have resale restrictions on platforms such as Amazon, Walmart, and others. It is your responsibility to confirm whether brand authorization is required and to obtain any necessary Letters of Authorization (LOAs) directly from the brand owner prior to making a purchase. Please note that brand policies are subject to change without notice. As a distributor, we do not issue LOAs, manufacturer authorization, or platform-specific documentation. We will provide our company invoice as proof of purchase only. All products we supply are sourced through legitimate and established distribution channels. Further sourcing details and supplier relationships are considered proprietary and will remain confidential.
